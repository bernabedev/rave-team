## How to Submit a Pull Request

To submit a pull request (PR):

1. **Sync Your Repository**: Make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch of the original repository.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make your changes in a separate branch and commit them with clear messages.
3. **Test Your Changes**: Make sure your changes don’t introduce any errors and that everything works as expected.
4. **Open the Pull Request**: Submit a PR from your branch to the main branch of the repository, including a detailed description of your changes.
5. **Wait for Review**: Maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback. Make any necessary modifications.

## Before sending a Pull Request

To avoid conflicts and ensure your fork is up-to-date with the original repository, **follow these steps carefully:**

### 1. Stash Any Local Changes (Optional)

If you have uncommitted changes and don't want to lose them:

```bash
  git stash
```

### 2. Add the Original Repository as upstream (Only Once)

If you haven’t added the original repo as a remote yet:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/afordigital/rave-team.git
```

### 3. Switch to Your main Branch

Ensure you are on your fork’s main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 4. Sync with the Original Repo (upstream)

Pull the latest changes from the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push the Updated Main Branch to Your Fork

Update your forked repo on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 6. Switch to Your Feature/PR Branch

Replace your-branch with the name of your working branch:

```bash
git checkout your-branch
```

### 7. Rebase Your Branch onto the Updated main

This helps avoid merge conflicts in your PR:

```bash
git rebase main
```

### 8. (Optional) Pop Your Stashed Changes Back

If you stashed earlier:

```bash
git stash pop
```

### 9. Push Your Branch

Push your rebased branch to your forked repo:

```bash
git push origin your-branch
```

If you rebased and already had pushed before, you may need to force push:

```bash
git push origin your-branch --force
```

### 10. Compare and Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub, and you should see a "Compare & pull request" button.
Click it, add a clear title and description for your PR, then submit it.

## Submitting Issues

To ensure your issue is handled efficiently:

1. **Provide Detailed Information**: Include relevant details about the bug or feature request. This can include steps to reproduce the issue, screenshots, or code examples.
2. **Use Appropriate Labels**: If possible, use the provided labels to categorize your issue (such as bug, enhancement, etc.).
3. **Be Clear and Concise**: Write a clear and to-the-point description so maintainers can quickly understand the issue or request.
4. **Check Existing Issues**: Before opening a new issue, review existing ones to ensure the same problem or request hasn't already been reported.
